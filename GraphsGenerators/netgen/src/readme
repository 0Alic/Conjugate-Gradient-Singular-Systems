netgen.shell:  NETGEN is described in Klingman, Napier, and Stutz, 
             ``NETGEN: A program for generating large scale capacitated
              assignment, transportation, and minimum-cost flow network
              problems,'' Management Science 20, 814-820 (1974).

               This is a Unix shell containing a version of NETGEN written
               in C.  Contributed by Norbert Schlenker.  Some copywrite
               restrictions apply---read the in-file comments.  

               To use, you just need to obtain and execute netgen.shell 
               (using /bin/sh (not csh)).  This  will create a Makefile 
               and other necessary files.  The compiler switches are 
               set for the DIMACS input/output format.
